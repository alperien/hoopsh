# hoopsh internals — a guided tour

Read [ARCHITECTURE.md](../ARCHITECTURE.md) first for the *why*; this is the *where*.
Everything below assumes the governing rule: **`engine` imports nothing; everything
else consumes its event stream.**

## The tick pipeline (10 Hz)

```
simulateGame(cfg)
 └─ tick(dt)                                 sim/game.ts
     ├─ wallT += dt                          (replay timeline: never pauses)
     ├─ phase dispatch:
     │   live        → tickLive              sim/game.ts
     │   dead        → tickDead              sim/possession.ts
     │   freethrows  → tickFreeThrows        sim/fouls.ts
     │   scramble    → tickScramble          sim/possession.ts
     └─ recordFrame                          sim/game.ts

tickLive, in order:
  advanceClock (game clock; stops at the horn) → ball flight? resolve on arrival
  → shot-clock violation check → period expiry → windup in progress?
  → possession phase transitions → holder movement intent → dribble accounting
  → decideBall() at each decision window → executeAction → reach-in checks
  → charge check → offense/defense brains → integrateMovement → fatigue
```

**Two time axes.** `t` is game-clock time (stops at whistles and the horn; stats and
minutes key on it). `wallT` is the replay timeline (advances every tick; frames and
event `wt` key on it). Do not mix them.

## Module map — `packages/engine/src/`

| File | Owns | Start here when changing… |
|---|---|---|
| `sim/game.ts` | orchestrator: init, tick dispatch, live tick, movement intents, frames | tick order, decision cadence, replay frames |
| `sim/possession.ts` | possession lifecycle, dead balls, scrambles, periods, tip | pace accounting, inbounds, period/OT rules |
| `sim/shooting.ts` | windup → release → resolution, assists | anything between "decides to shoot" and the rim |
| `sim/passing.ts` | pass flight, steals/OOB, reach-ins | turnover mechanics |
| `sim/fouls.ts` | foul bookkeeping, bonus, FT sequences | whistle rules |
| `sim/subs.ts` | lineup swaps, fatigue rotation, foul-out replacement | rotations |
| `sim/movement.ts` | clock advance, physical integration, collision, fatigue | locomotion, energy |
| `sim/ai.ts` | decideBall utilities, spacing/cuts, pick-and-roll, man defense | **all basketball behavior** |
| `sim/resolve.ts` | probability models: shots, contests, passes, rebounds | make/miss math |
| `sim/params.ts` | **every tunable constant** (`SimParams`) | calibration; never hardcode a constant elsewhere |
| `sim/state.ts` | shared types + `emit()` | event stamping, new state fields |
| `core/events.ts` | the event schema — **the public contract** | anything consumers see |
| `core/rng.ts` | seeded sfc32 + distributions | never use Math.random |
| `geometry/court.ts` | court build, shot zones, spacing spots | three-point geometry |
| `rules/rulepack.ts` | league packs (NBA/NCAA/EURO) | league differences |
| `model/player.ts` | attributes & tendencies (the 37 dials) | the editable surface |
| `model/derived.ts` | rating → physical-unit curves | what "90 speed" means |
| `replay/replay.ts` | replay JSON assembly | viewer data needs |

Consumers: `stats/box.ts` (events → box score, exact minutes/±), `data/` (schemas,
validation, archetypes, sample packs), `narration/` (frozen demo layer),
`harness/` (batch runner, bands, sweep, benchmarks), `packages/viewer/` (prototype).

## Design rules that maintain consistency across this codebase

1. **One probability form.** Every resolution is `sigmoid(base + Σ terms)`; every
   constant lives in `SimParams`. Rating influence goes through `n(rating)` ∈ [-1, 1].
2. **Self-consistent AI.** The model that resolves a shot is the model the AI uses to
   *choose* it (`shotEV` calls `shotMakeP`). Decision and outcome cannot drift apart.
3. **Determinism is mandatory.** One seeded `Rng` per game. No `Math.random`, no `Date`,
   no iteration-order dependence. Same seed ⇒ bit-identical events + frames.
4. **Events are the only truth.** If a consumer needs something, it goes in the event
   stream — never reach into engine internals.
5. **Actions are thin scaffolding.** Pick-and-roll sets up geometry (screen contact,
   stun, roll); the payoff (pull-up space, pocket pass) *emerges* from existing systems.
   The post-up follows the same shape: the entry reuses the pass model, the double-team
   reuses help defense, and the spray out of the double reuses kick-out machinery.
6. **Staged surface is labeled.** Fields marked `STAGED` in `model/player.ts`
   (`consistency`, `tend.pushPace`) are defined but not yet consumed — each is
   tied to a roadmap stage. Wiring one without its stage's mechanics adds unvalidated
   surface area.

## The safety net (run all of it before pushing)

```bash
npm run test     # 50 tests: determinism, geometry, archetypes, narration, schema,
                 # wide-band realism guard, and the INVARIANT SUITE (below)
npm run batch -- --games 24    # fine-grained NBA acceptance bands
npm run bench    # ≥1 game/sec budget (typical ~6)
```

`packages/engine/test/invariants.test.ts` permanently enforces what two adversarial
audit rounds verified: possession start/end balance, zero post-horn scoring, exact
minutes conservation, plus-minus ≡ margin×5, score reconstructible from events, no
off-court or fouled-out actors, team-foul monotonicity, strictly monotonic replay
frames, and a physical teleport ceiling on player movement. **Policy: if a change to
the engine makes an invariant fail, the change is treated as wrong — never the
invariant.**

## Calibration workflow

1. Change mechanics → `npm test` (invariants + wide guard must stay green).
2. `npm run batch -- --games 24` → see which bands drifted.
3. `npm run sweep -- --iters 14 --cands 4 --games 12 --verify 40` → let the optimizer
   re-center; bake the printed diff into `params.ts` defaults; verify with
   `npm run sweep -- --iters 0 --verify 40`.
4. Expect the noise floor: at 40-game samples, single bands graze edges by <1% on
   some seeds. 46–48 of 48 checks passing with sub-5% misses is a locked state.

## Known simplifications (deliberate, documented)

Simplified inbounds (timed reset, no inbound passer) · no timeouts · no backcourt/
8-second/travel violations · NBA last-2-minutes bonus rule not yet implemented ·
league assists run ~1 under the band floor (the sole Stage 2 calibration
residual — 45/48 checks at 40 games x 3 seeds; unassisted post twos and
live-ball strips replaced some assisted catch-and-shoot volume, and the
underlying assisted-share gap below is the real fix) ·
league assisted-share ~46-50% of makes vs NBA ~58% (no acceptance band constrains
it yet; gates the floor-general 6+ apg level ratchet in archetypes.test.ts) ·
man-to-man with drop coverage only ·
bench-exhausted foul-outs play on (NBA rule analog: a fouled-out player remains
when no substitute exists — reachable only with short/foul-storm rosters; the
no-fouled-out-actors invariant applies whenever replacements exist, and every
lineup-consuming site falls back consistently rather than crashing — hardened
after the Stage 2 adversarial audit) ·
narration/viewer are frozen prototypes.
